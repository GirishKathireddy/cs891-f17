# Assignment - Week 6

***Work in Progress***

The goal of this assignment is to get you started creating your own web collections and to compare the different tools that you can use to create collections.

Pick a topic that you care about and choose 15 URIs to "seed" your collection. 

Create collections (with the same 15 seeds) using the following tools:
* [Archive-It](https://archive-it.org)
* [webrecorder.io](https://webrecorder.io)
* [WAIL](https://github.com/N0taN3rd/wail)
* [WARCreate](http://warcreate.com) / WAIL -- use WARCreate to create the WARCs and import them into WAIL (a separate collection from your native WAIL collection)

Make sure that you have a mix of seeds -- some that are appropriate for page-only archiving and some that are appropriate for deeper crawling.

Create at least one capture of each seed per week.

**Due Next Week (Oct 11)**

Create a page in github that lists your 15 seeds (link to the live web) and contains links to your collections in webrecorder.io and Archive-It.

**Due in 2 Weeks (Oct 18)**

Be prepared to discuss in class the process of creating your collection.  Compare and contrast the different tools in terms of capture quality, ease of use, etc. What were the advantages and disadvantages of each tool?  Did some tools work better than others on certain types of pages? Were 15 seeds enough to characterize the topic you wanted to cover?
