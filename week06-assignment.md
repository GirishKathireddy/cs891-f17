# Assignment - Week 6

***Work in Progress***

The goal of this assignment is to get you started creating your own web collections and to compare the different tools that you can use to create collections.

Pick a topic that you care about and choose 15 URIs to "seed" your collection. 

Create collections using the following tools:
* [Archive-It](https://archive-it.org)
* [webrecorder.io](https://webrecorder.io)
* [WAIL](https://github.com/N0taN3rd/wail)
* [WARCreate](http://warcreate.com) / WAIL -- use WARCreate to create the WARCs and import them into WAIL (a separate collection from your native WAIL collection)

**Due Next Week (Oct 11)**

Create a page in github that lists your 15 seeds (link to the live web) and contains links to your collections in webrecorder.io and Archive-It.

**Due in 2 Weeks (Oct 18)**

Discuss the process of creating your collection.  Compare and contrast the different tools in terms of capture quality, ease of use, etc. Were 15 seeds enough to characterize the topic you wanted to cover?
